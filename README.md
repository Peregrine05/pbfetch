An unbelievably customizable hardware/software fetch. No more being limited to a logo on the left.

## Installation:
Rye:
> In `/pbfetch/` use `rye sync` and `rye run pbfetch` to run fetch.
> 
Binary:
> To run the fetch with just `pbfetch`, navigate to `pbfetch/bin/` and use `makepkg -si`. This will prompt you for a password because it must install a default config in `/usr/share/pbfetch/config/`.
